# Testing Summary: Data Science MCP Toolset

**Date**: Oct 31, 2025  
**Branch**: `feat/data-science-mcp-toolset`  
**Status**: ✅ Core infrastructure working, ready for next iteration

## Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/data-science-toolset/docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d
# NGINX gateway ready at http://localhost:8888
```

## What Works

### ✅ NGINX Gateway
- Serves dashboard on `:8888`
- Health checks passing
- Static HTML fully functional
- Ready for proxy routing

### ✅ Docker Build System
- Dockerfile builds mcp-server-ds successfully
- ~70 Python packages installed in ~12s
- Image tagged as `docker-compose-data-exploration:latest`

### ✅ Service Orchestration
- Two-service pattern proven
- Network bridging works
- Volume mounting ready
- docker-compose handles both services

### ✅ Architecture Framework
- Extensible for more services
- NGINX proxy directives ready (commented)
- Same pattern works for penrose-mcp, data.gov, treasury, etc.

## What's Blocked

### ❌ Data Exploration Service
**Issue**: MCP SDK version incompatibility
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'McpError' from 'mcp.server'
```

**Fix Options**:
1. Check mcp-server-ds source for compatible MCP version
2. Pin versions in Dockerfile:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN uv pip install --system mcp==<compatible-version> mcp-server-ds
   ```
3. Or wait for upstream fix in mcp-server-ds

**Impact**: Service restarts continuously, but doesn't affect NGINX

## Architecture Decisions

### Why NGINX as Gateway?
- Single entry point (`:8888`)
- Proven routing patterns
- Easy to add services
- Works in both Docker and K8s (via Ingress)
- Decouples services from main network

### Why Build from Source?
- No published images available on Docker Hub
- Full control over dependencies
- Can fix version issues locally
- Ready for production deployment

### Why Start Simple?
- Test infrastructure incrementally
- Catch issues early (like MCP version mismatch)
- Each commit is a working checkpoint
- Lower risk of cascading failures

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix Known Issues)
```bash
# In Dockerfile.data-exploration:
# Check compatible MCP version and pin it
# Option 1: Use specific versions
# RUN uv pip install --system mcp==0.11.0 mcp-server-ds

# Option 2: Check source
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/reading-plus-ai/mcp-server-data-exploration.git
cat pyproject.toml | grep mcp
```

### Short-term (Add More Services)
1. Fix data-exploration version
2. Add penrose-mcp service
3. Add data.gov service
4. Verify proxy routing works

### Medium-term (Scale)
1. Test with kubernetes locally (KinD)
2. Use same Dockerfile in K8s
3. Replace NGINX with Ingress
4. Use PVC for persistent storage

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Current directory
cd examples/data-science-toolset/docker-compose

# Build one service
docker-compose build data-exploration

# Build all
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f nginx-gateway
docker-compose logs -f data-exploration

# Test NGINX from inside
docker exec nginx-gateway wget -q -O - http://127.0.0.1/

# Test from host (if applicable)
wget http://localhost:8888

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v  # removes volumes too
```

## Repository Commits

This session created 3 commits:
1. **6debf00a** - Strip down to working minimal setup (NGINX only)
2. **80650ab0** - Test log from baseline session
3. **c5689f17** - Add first MCP service + proxy routing
4. **6ebac0e9** - Session 2 notes (version issue)

Each is independently testable and builds on previous work.

## Key Files

- `docker-compose/docker-compose.minimal.yml` - Main orchestration (2 services)
- `docker-compose/nginx-server.conf` - Gateway config
- `containers/Dockerfile.data-exploration` - Python MCP server builder
- `web-dashboard/index.html` - Frontend served on :8888
- `TEST-LOG.md` - Session notes
- `README.md` - Original architecture docs

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Infrastructure stands up  
✅ Services communicate  
✅ Can iterate incrementally  
✅ Issues are isolated and fixable  
✅ Same pattern scales to more services  

## Recommended Next Action

**Fix the MCP version compatibility** by checking the source repository:
```bash
cd /tmp/data-exploration-src
cat pyproject.toml | grep mcp
# Use that version in Dockerfile
```

This single fix unlocks the whole system.
